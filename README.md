# E-Commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website project with a basic structure, using HTML and CSS. The website includes multiple pages with cards and images, and links to other sections.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
e-commerce-website/
├── image/           # Folder containing images used in the project
├── index.html       # Main homepage of the website
└── main.html        # Additional page with product details or other sections
```

### File Descriptions:

- **index.html**: The main homepage of the e-commerce website. This file contains the website's primary layout and sections, including navigation, product cards, and clickable images.
- **main.html**: A secondary page that could be used for product listings or detailed information. This page is linked from the images or cards in `index.html`.
- **image/**: This folder stores all the images used in the project. Ensure that all image file paths are correct and point to this directory.

## Features

- **Card Layout**: The website includes a card-based layout, each card containing an image that leads to another page when clicked.
- **Image Linking**: Clicking on images in the cards directs the user to other sections or pages (e.g., `main.html`).
- **Expandable**: The project is designed to be easily expanded with additional sections or features.

## How to Use

### 1. Download or Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Varshhaa128/EcommerceWebsite.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in a Web Browser:

Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in any modern web browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### 3. Customize as Needed:

- You can add or modify cards by editing the HTML files (`index.html` or `main.html`).
- Images can be added to the `image` folder and linked in the HTML files.

## How to Add More Cards and Images

To add more cards or images:

1. **Add an image** to the `image/` folder.
2. **Modify the HTML**: In `index.html`, add a new card inside the `<section>` tag:

```html
<div class="card">
  <a href="main.html">
    <img src="image/your-image.png" alt="Product Image">
  </a>
</div>
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To build the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: To style the layout and appearance of the website.

## Future Enhancements

- **JavaScript**: Can be added to enhance interactivity (e.g., product filtering, dynamic content).
- **Backend**: Integration with a backend system (e.g., Node.js, Python) for e-commerce functionality (shopping cart, user authentication)
